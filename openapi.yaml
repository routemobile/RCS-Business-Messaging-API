      description: >-
        Login APIs provide a secure and standardized way for end users to add
        user authentication to their applications. Only authorized users can
        access sensitive resources or perform specific actions within the
        application after entering the user authentication details.


        **By default, the JSON Web Token (JWT) validity periods are set to one
        hour.**

      summary: RCS Messages API
      description: >-
        The Rich Communication Services (RCS) Business Messaging API is a
        communication protocol that allows businesses to send different types of
        messages beyond traditional text messages. 


        The RCS Business Messaging API allows businesses to send different types
        of messages that include:


        - **Notification API:** Standard text messages that send plain text
        content. 

        - **Session API:** Standard text messages that send plain text content
        as part of a campaign. 

        - **India Template API:** Create interactive and visually rich content
        to engage customers.

        The Payment Template API allows businesses to integrate payment
        functionality into their RCS messages. With this API, businesses can
        create payment templates that enable users to make secure payments
        directly within the RCS messaging experience.


        The API will use the provided phone number to send the payment template
        message to the recipient via RCS. The template will include the
        specified variables and their corresponding values, allowing you to
        customize the payment details for each recipient.

      description: >
        The Bulk Capability Checks API allows you to retrieve the capabilities
        of multiple contacts in a single request. This API is useful when you
        want to check the capabilities of a group of contacts instead of making
        individual requests for each contact.


        By sending this GET request to the specified URL with the JSON payload,
        you will receive a response containing information about the
        capabilities of the specified contacts.
